//! A namespace that stitches several stores into one filesystem.
//!
//! A [`ContextFs`] is a longest-prefix mount table: each store is registered at a root-relative
//! path and serves every request that falls under it, with the path re-based onto the store's
//! own root.
//!
//! It is itself a [`FileSystem`], so it can be driven by the same bindings as any single
//! store — and even mounted inside another one. That costs nothing to arrange now that the
//! trait is object-safe: the table holds `Box<dyn FileSystem>` and forwards, where a trait
//! with an associated handle type would need the whole call erased and re-typed on the way
//! through.
//!
//! **The `mount` here is the table's, not the operating system's.**
//! [`mount`](ContextFs::mount) grafts a store onto a path in *this* tree and nothing outside the
//! process learns of it. Putting the result where a kernel can see it is
//! [`Mount`](crate::fs::Mount), which is what a binding hands back — so a `ContextFs` with ten
//! mounts in it may still be mounted nowhere at all.
