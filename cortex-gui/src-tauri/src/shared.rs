//! The workspace as something that can be mounted, without giving it away.
//!
//! A binding takes ownership of what it serves — `FuseTMount::try_new(fs, …)` moves the
//! `FileSystem` in, keeps a raw pointer into it, and dereferences that on every request for the
//! life of the mount. That is the right shape for a program whose whole job is one mount, and
//! the wrong one for this window: connecting Notion is `WorkFs::mount`, which needs the
//! workspace back afterwards.
//!
//! So the thing handed to the binding is this — a handle onto the workspace rather than the
//! workspace. It is a [`FileSystem`] that forwards, the window keeps a clone, and a mount
//! taken down releases only the handle.
//!
//! **Every method takes the read lock, writes included.** That is not an oversight: the trait's
//! methods all take `&self`, so a store's own interior mutability is what serves a write, and
//! the only `&mut WorkFs` in the crate is the mount table — `mount` and `unmount`. A FUSE
//! request and a connector being attached are therefore a reader and a writer of the *table*,
//! which is exactly what they are.
