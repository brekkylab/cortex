//! napi's link setup, and delay-loading `dokan2.dll` when the `mount` feature is on for a
//! Windows MSVC target.
//!
//! virtx's own `build.rs` asks for the delay-load, but a `rustc-link-arg` applies only to
//! the targets of the package that printed it — so a dependent that is itself linked, as
//! this cdylib is, has to ask again. Without it `require` fails in the loader on a host
//! without Dokany, including for the callers that never mount; with it the DLL is loaded
//! by the first mount, which `virtx::fs::mount_support` checks for first.
//!
//! macOS needs nothing here: the FUSE-T shim opens libfuse-t itself, at run time.
