//! Delay-loads `dokan2.dll` when the `mount` feature is on for a Windows MSVC target.
//!
//! virtx's own `build.rs` asks for the same, but a `rustc-link-arg` applies only to the
//! targets of the package that printed it — so a dependent that is itself linked, as this
//! cdylib is, has to ask again. Without it the import fails in the loader with
//! `DLL load failed` on a host without Dokany, including for the callers that never mount;
//! with it the DLL is loaded by the first mount, which `virtx::fs::mount_support` checks
//! for first.
//!
//! macOS needs nothing here: the FUSE-T shim opens libfuse-t itself, at run time.
